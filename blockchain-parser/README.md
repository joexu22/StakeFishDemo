Revised Blockchain Parser
=================

## Info
by Joe Xu

The repo contains proof of concept code that tallies how many blocks have timestamps that are 2 hours apart.

This code leverages existing code that parses all **blkXXXXX.dat** generated by coinbase-core.

As the existing code executes through and parses the data, rather than take the full parse, this code instead tallies Timestamp signatures. Assuming that all blocks are in sequential (hex) epoch time, this code calculates a difference of 2 hours and adds it to total tally.

## Usage

Run ```python3 blockchain-parser-hextime.py```

Make sure you change the paths for **blkXXXXX.dat** files and for the parsing results to yours. The script works only with fully downloaded blockchain **dat** files (that are ~134Mb).

This script convert the full blockchain raw database that is stored in **blkXXXXX.dat** files an count <XXX>,<YXX> in a **txt** file. <XXX>, is the stack height and the <YYY> is the number of blocks that are 2 hours apart. e.g. 119965, 7887 would mean at stack height 119965 there are 7887 blocks 2 hours apart.
